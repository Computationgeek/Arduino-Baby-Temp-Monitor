# Arduino-Baby-Temp-Monitor
The Arduino baby monitor, leveraging the power-efficient Arduino Nano microcontroller, continuously monitors room temperature, ensuring precision in readings for optimal baby comfort. With a swift two-second update interval, the device employs a 16x2 I2C LCD and tri-colored LEDs for intuitive feedback. The Red LED blinks when temperatures exceed 25°C, the Green LED remains steadily lit to signify a safe temperature range, while the Blue LED indicates a chilly condition (<20°C), alerting caregivers to potential discomfort for the baby. The project's low current consumption further enhances its efficiency, guaranteeing prolonged and reliable operation.
